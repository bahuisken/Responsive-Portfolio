                        <p class="profile-text">Brice Huisken has spent most of his career in MarTech in client facing
                            roles, supporting marketers and developers. There has always been a technical aspect to the
                            roles he's had, mostly related to the SaaS platforms that he has helped Customers adopt or
                            onboard to. Brice has been able to dip his toes into developemt throughout his career, when
                            working in the Digital Advertising field, Email Marketing, and now CDP. As he touches more
                            and more web technologies, he's been motivated to add more technical skills to his toolbox
                            and better speak to the dev language(s). So, Brice has recently enrolled in the University
                            of Denver Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. The knowledge that he obtains will not only help him
                            grow, it will also allow him to better support his customers. And who knows, maybe in the
                            future he can dive into  fully technical roles.</p>

                            he's building and learning as he makes his way through the bootcamp. Make sure to check back
                            often as the portfolio grows. If you like was you see, please <a
                                href="contact.html">contact</a> Brice! He's open to feedback, encouragement, and even
                            opportunites.</p>
                        <p>From a personal perspective, Brice is a Colorado native, and outside of work, he enjoys all
                            the splendor the state has to offer. He has a wonderful wife, Kate, and two great kids,
                            Avery and Bennett. If you can't find him at one of his kid's school activities, or coaching
                            one of their teams, you'll certainly find him watching or attending a sporting event. Brice
                            is also a huge music fan with an impressive collection.</p>
